@article{Shankavaram2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in the high-throughput omic technologies have made it possible to profile cells in a large number of ways at the DNA, RNA, protein, chromosomal, functional, and pharmacological levels. A persistent problem is that some classes of molecular data are labeled with gene identifiers, others with transcript or protein identifiers, and still others with chromosomal locations. What has lagged behind is the ability to integrate the resulting data to uncover complex relationships and patterns. Those issues are reflected in full form by molecular profile data on the panel of 60 diverse human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) used since 1990 by the U.S. National Cancer Institute to screen compounds for anticancer activity. To our knowledge, CellMiner is the first online database resource for integration of the diverse molecular types of NCI-60 and related meta data.

DESCRIPTION: CellMiner enables scientists to perform advanced querying of molecular information on NCI-60 (and additional types) through a single web interface. CellMiner is a freely available tool that organizes and stores raw and normalized data that represent multiple types of molecular characterizations at the DNA, RNA, protein, and pharmacological levels. Annotations for each project, along with associated metadata on the samples and datasets, are stored in a MySQL database and linked to the molecular profile data. Data can be queried and downloaded along with comprehensive information on experimental and analytic methods for each data set. A Data Intersection tool allows selection of a list of genes (proteins) in common between two or more data sets and outputs the data for those genes (proteins) in the respective sets. In addition to its role as an integrative resource for the NCI-60, the CellMiner package also serves as a shell for incorporation of molecular profile data on other cell or tissue sample types.

CONCLUSION: CellMiner is a relational database tool for storing, querying, integrating, and downloading molecular profile data on the NCI-60 and other cancer cell types. More broadly, it provides a template to use in providing such functionality for other molecular profile data generated by academic institutions, public projects, or the private sector. CellMiner is available online at (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/).},

abstract = {High-throughput and high-content databases are increasingly important resources in molecular medicine, systems biology, and pharmacology. However, the information usually resides in unwieldy databases, limiting ready data analysis and integration. One resource that offers substantial potential for improvement in this regard is the NCI-60 cell line database compiled by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, which has been extensively characterized across numerous genomic and pharmacologic response platforms. In this report, we introduce a CellMiner (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/) web application designed to improve the use of this extensive database. CellMiner tools allowed rapid data retrieval of transcripts for 22,379 genes and 360 microRNAs along with activity reports for 20,503 chemical compounds including 102 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Converting these differential levels into quantitative patterns across the NCI-60 clarified data organization and cross-comparisons using a novel pattern match tool. Data queries for potential relationships among parameters can be conducted in an iterative manner specific to user interests and expertise. Examples of the in silico discovery process afforded by CellMiner were provided for multidrug resistance analyses and doxorubicin activity; identification of colon-specific genes, microRNAs, and drugs; microRNAs related to the miR-17-92 cluster; and drug identification patterns matched to erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and lapatinib. CellMiner greatly broadens applications of the extensive NCI-60 database for discovery by creating web-based processes that are rapid, flexible, and readily applied by users without bioinformatics expertise.},

abstract = {Analysis of microbiome dynamics would allow elucidation of patterns within microbial community evolution under a variety of biologically or economically important circumstances ; however, this is currently hampered in part by the lack of rigorous, formal, yet generally-applicable approaches to discerning distinct configurations of complex microbial populations. Clustering approaches to define microbiome ''community state-types'' at a population-scale are widely used, though not yet standardized. Similarly, distinct variations within a state-type are well documented, but there is no rigorous approach to discriminating these more subtle variations in community structure. Finally, intra-individual variations with even fewer differences will likely be found in, for example, longitudinal data, and will correlate with important features such as sickness versus health. We propose an automated, generic, objective, domain-independent, and internally-validating procedure to define statistically distinct microbiome states within datasets containing any degree of phylotypic diversity. Robustness of state identification is objectively established by a combination of diverse techniques for stable cluster verification. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in detecting discreet states even in datasets containing highly similar bacterial communities, and to demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we reuse eight distinct longitudinal microbiome datasets from a variety of ecological niches and species. We also demonstrate our algorithm's flexibility by providing it distinct taxa subsets as clustering input, demonstrating that it operates on filtered or unfiltered data, and at a range of different taxonomic levels. The final output is a set of robustly defined states which can then be used as general biomarkers for a wide variety of downstream purposes such as association with disease, monitoring response to intervention, or identifying optimally performant populations.},

abstract = {Cattle and other ruminants produce large quantities of methane ({\~{}}110 million metric tonnes per annum), which is a potent greenhouse gas affecting global climate change. Methane (CH 4) is a natural by-product of gastro-enteric microbial fermentation of feedstuffs in the rumen and contributes to 6{\%} of total CH 4 emissions from anthropogenic-related sources. The extent to which the host genome and rumen microbiome influence CH 4 emission is not yet well known. This study confirms individual variation in CH 4 production was influenced by individual host (cow) genotype, as well as the host's rumen microbiome composition. Abundance of a small proportion of bacteria and archaea taxa were influenced to a limited extent by the host's genotype and certain taxa were associated with CH 4 emissions. However, the cumulative effect of all bacteria and archaea on CH 4 production was 13{\%}, the host genetics (heritability) was 21{\%} and the two are largely independent. This study demonstrates variation in CH 4 emission is likely not modulated through cow genetic effects on the rumen microbiome. Therefore, the rumen microbiome and cow genome could be targeted independently, by breeding low methane-emitting cows and in parallel, by investigating possible strategies that target changes in the rumen microbiome to reduce CH 4 emissions in the cattle industry.},

@article{Morgavi2010,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Ruminant production is under increased public scrutiny in terms of the importance of cattle and other ruminants as major producers of the greenhouse gas methane. Methanogenesis is performed by methanogenic archaea, a specialised group of microbes present in several anaerobic environments including the rumen. In the rumen, methanogens utilise predominantly H {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and CO {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} as substrates to produce methane, filling an important functional niche in the ecosystem. However, in addition to methanogens, other microbes also have an influence on methane production either because they are involved in hydrogen (H {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} ) metabolism or because they affect the numbers of methanogens or other members of the microbiota. This study explores the relationship between some of these microbes and methanogenesis and highlights some functional groups that could play a role in decreasing methane emissions. Dihydrogen (‘H {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} ' from this point on) is the key element that drives methane production in the rumen. Among H {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} producers, protozoa have a prominent position, which is strengthened by their close physical association with methanogens, which favours H {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} transfer from one to the other. A strong positive interaction was found between protozoal numbers and methane emissions, and because this group is possibly not essential for rumen function, protozoa might be a target for methane mitigation. An important function that is associated with production of H {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} is the degradation of fibrous plant material. However, not all members of the rumen fibrolytic community produce H {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} . Increasing the proportion of non-H {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} producing fibrolytic microorganisms might decrease methane production without affecting forage degradability. Alternative pathways that use electron acceptors other than CO {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} to oxidise H {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} also exist in the rumen. Bacteria with this type of metabolism normally occupy a distinct ecological niche and are not dominant members of the microbiota; however, their numbers can increase if the right potential electron acceptor is present in the diet. Nitrate is an alternative electron sinks that can promote the growth of particular bacteria able to compete with methanogens. Because of the toxicity of the intermediate product, nitrite, the use of nitrate has not been fully explored, but in adapted animals, nitrite does not accumulate and nitrate supplementation may be an alternative under some dietary conditions that deserves to be further studied. In conclusion, methanogens in the rumen co-exist with other microbes, which have contrasting activities. A better understanding of these populations and the pathways that compete with methanogenesis may provide novel targets for emissions abatement in ruminant production. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The rumen is a complex ecosystem composed of anaerobic bacteria, protozoa, fungi, methanogenic archaea and phages. These microbes interact closely to breakdown plant material that is inedible for humans, whilst providing metabolic energy to the host and producing methane. Consequently, ruminants produce meat and milk, which are rich in high quality protein, vitamins and minerals and therefore contribute to food security. As world population is predicted to reach approximately 9.7 billion by 2050, ruminant production has to increase to satisfy global protein demand, despite limited land availability, whilst ensuring environmental impact is minimised. These goals can be met by deepening our understanding of the rumen microbiome. Attempts to manipulate the rumen microbiome to benefit global agricultural challenges have been ongoing for decades with limited success, mostly due to the lack of a detailed understanding of this microbiome and our limited ability to culture most of these microbes outside the rumen. The potential to manipulate the rumen microbiome and meet global livestock challenges through animal breeding and introduction of dietary interventions during early life have recently emerged as promising new technologies. Our inability to phenotype ruminants in a high-throughput manner has also hampered progress, although the recent increase in ‘omic' data may allow further development of mathematical models and rumen microbial gene biomarkers as proxies. Advances in computational tools, high-throughput sequencing technologies and cultivation-independent ‘omics' approaches continue to revolutionise our understanding of the rumen microbiome. This will ultimately provide the knowledge framework needed to solve current and future ruminant livestock challenges.},

@article{Shankavaram2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in the high-throughput omic technologies have made it possible to profile cells in a large number of ways at the DNA, RNA, protein, chromosomal, functional, and pharmacological levels. A persistent problem is that some classes of molecular data are labeled with gene identifiers, others with transcript or protein identifiers, and still others with chromosomal locations. What has lagged behind is the ability to integrate the resulting data to uncover complex relationships and patterns. Those issues are reflected in full form by molecular profile data on the panel of 60 diverse human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) used since 1990 by the U.S. National Cancer Institute to screen compounds for anticancer activity. To our knowledge, CellMiner is the first online database resource for integration of the diverse molecular types of NCI-60 and related meta data.

DESCRIPTION: CellMiner enables scientists to perform advanced querying of molecular information on NCI-60 (and additional types) through a single web interface. CellMiner is a freely available tool that organizes and stores raw and normalized data that represent multiple types of molecular characterizations at the DNA, RNA, protein, and pharmacological levels. Annotations for each project, along with associated metadata on the samples and datasets, are stored in a MySQL database and linked to the molecular profile data. Data can be queried and downloaded along with comprehensive information on experimental and analytic methods for each data set. A Data Intersection tool allows selection of a list of genes (proteins) in common between two or more data sets and outputs the data for those genes (proteins) in the respective sets. In addition to its role as an integrative resource for the NCI-60, the CellMiner package also serves as a shell for incorporation of molecular profile data on other cell or tissue sample types.

CONCLUSION: CellMiner is a relational database tool for storing, querying, integrating, and downloading molecular profile data on the NCI-60 and other cancer cell types. More broadly, it provides a template to use in providing such functionality for other molecular profile data generated by academic institutions, public projects, or the private sector. CellMiner is available online at (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/).},

@article{Reinhold2012,
abstract = {High-throughput and high-content databases are increasingly important resources in molecular medicine, systems biology, and pharmacology. However, the information usually resides in unwieldy databases, limiting ready data analysis and integration. One resource that offers substantial potential for improvement in this regard is the NCI-60 cell line database compiled by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, which has been extensively characterized across numerous genomic and pharmacologic response platforms. In this report, we introduce a CellMiner (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/) web application designed to improve the use of this extensive database. CellMiner tools allowed rapid data retrieval of transcripts for 22,379 genes and 360 microRNAs along with activity reports for 20,503 chemical compounds including 102 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Converting these differential levels into quantitative patterns across the NCI-60 clarified data organization and cross-comparisons using a novel pattern match tool. Data queries for potential relationships among parameters can be conducted in an iterative manner specific to user interests and expertise. Examples of the in silico discovery process afforded by CellMiner were provided for multidrug resistance analyses and doxorubicin activity; identification of colon-specific genes, microRNAs, and drugs; microRNAs related to the miR-17-92 cluster; and drug identification patterns matched to erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and lapatinib. CellMiner greatly broadens applications of the extensive NCI-60 database for discovery by creating web-based processes that are rapid, flexible, and readily applied by users without bioinformatics expertise.},
